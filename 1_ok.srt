2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,880

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,880
to be with you today

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,400
for your commencement from one of the

5
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,520
told uh I never graduated

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,640
from college and uh this is the closest

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:46,640
I've ever gotten to a college

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,079
graduation today I want to tell you

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,760
three stories from my life that's

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,760
it no big deal just three

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
stories the first story

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
is about connecting the dots

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,799
I dropped out of Reed College after the

14
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,920
first 6 months but then stayed around

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,200
as a drop in for

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,200
another 18 months or so before

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,159
I really quit

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,159
so why' I drop out it started before

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,759
I was born

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,759
my biological mother was a young

21
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,159
unwed graduate student and she decided

22
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,720
to put me up for

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,000
adoption she felt very strongly that

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
I should be adopted by college graduates

25
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,720
so everything was all set for me to

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,640
be adopted at Birth

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,640
by a lawyer and a

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,320
his wife except that when I popped out

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,640
they decided at the last

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,640
minute that they really wanted a

31
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,240
girl so

32
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,240
my parents who were on a waiting

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
list got a call

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
in the middle of the

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,759
night asking we've got an unexpected

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,360
baby boy do you

37
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,360
want him they said of

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,560
course my biological mother found out

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
later that my mother had never graduated

40
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,159
from college and that my father had

41
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,200
never graduated from high school

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,680
she refused to signed the final adoption

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,200
papers she only relented a few months

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,679
later when my parents promised that

45
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,720
I would go to college

46
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,720
this was the start in

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,160
my life and 17 years later

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,160
I did go

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,319
to college but I naively chose a college

50
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,720
that was almost as expensive

51
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,560
as Stanford and all of my workingclass

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,800
parents savings were being spent on

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,599
my college tuition after 6 months

54
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,319
I couldn't see the value in it

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,760
I had no idea what

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,760
I wanted to do with

57
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,080
my life and no idea how College was

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,120
going to help me

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,120
figure it out and here

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,400
I was spending all the money my parents

61
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
had saved their entire life so

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
I decided to drop out and trust

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,519
that it would all work out okay

64
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,480
it was pretty scary

65
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,480
at the time but looking

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,920
back it was one of the best decisions

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,120
I ever made the minute I dropped out

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,840
I could stop taking the required classes that

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,599
didn't interest me and begin dropping

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,480
in on the ones that looked far more

71
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
interesting it wasn't all romantic

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
I didn't have a dorm room

73
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
so I slept

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,000
on the floor in friends rooms I returned

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Coke bottles for the 5-cent deposits

76
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,360
to buy food with and

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,360
I would walk the seven

78
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,159
miles across town every Sunday night

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,040
to get one good meal

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,040
a week at the Hari

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,319
Krishna Temple I loved it and much of

82
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
what I stumbled into by following

83
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
my curiosity and intuition turned out to

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
be Priceless later on

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
let me give you one

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,239
example Reed College at that time

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
offered perhaps the best calligraphy

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,560
instruction in the country throughout

89
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,159
the campus every poster every label

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
on every drawer was beautifully hand

91
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,599
cigraph because I had dropped out

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,239
and didn't have to take the normal classes

93
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,519
I decided to take a calligraphy class

94
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,400
to learn how to do this I learned

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,959
about serif and Sans serif type faces

96
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,079
about varying the amount of space between

97
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,159
different letter combinations about what makes great typography

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,400
great it was beautiful historical

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,879
artistically subtle in a way that

100
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,560
science can't capture and I found it

101
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,280
fascinating none of this had even a hope

102
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,160
of any practical application in

103
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,479
my life but 10

104
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,479
years later when we were

105
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,040
designing the first Macintosh computer

106
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,479
it all came back

107
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,479
to me and we designed

108
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
it all into the

109
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
Mac it was the first

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
computer with beautiful typography if

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
I had never never dropped

112
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,520
in on that single course in college the

113
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,120
Mac would have never had multiple type

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
faces or proportionately spaced fonts

115
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
and since Windows just copi the Mac it's

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
them if

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
I had never dropped out I would

118
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,880
have never dropped in on that

119
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
calligraphy class and personal computers

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
might not have the wonderful typography

121
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,320
that they do of course it was impossible

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,880
to connect the dots looking forward when

123
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,000
I was in college

124
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,000
but it was very very

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,199
clear looking backwards 10 years later

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,080
again you can't connect the dots looking

127
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,639
forward you can only connect them

128
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,280
looking backwards so you have to trust

129
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,320
that the dots will somehow connect

130
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,560
in your future you have to trust

131
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,840
in something your gut Destiny Life Karma

132
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,360
whatever because believing that the dots

133
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
will connect down the road will give you

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,800
the confidence to follow your heart even

135
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,639
when it leads you off the well-worn path

136
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:33,639
path and that will make all the

137
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,680
difference my second story is about love

138
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,160
and loss

139
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,160
I was lucky I found what I love

140
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,639
to do early in life W and

141
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,639
I started Apple

142
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,880
in my parents garage when

143
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,880
I was 20 we

144
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,240
worked hard and in 10 years Apple had

145
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,759
grown from Just the

146
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,759
Two of Us in a

147
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,600
garage into A2 billion doll company with

148
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
over 4,000 employees we just released

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
our finest creation the Macintosh a year

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,720
earlier and I just turned

151
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,919
30 and then I got

152
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,160
fired how can you get

153
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,160
fired from a company you

154
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,680
started well as Apple grew we hired

155
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,639
someone who I thought was very talented

156
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,840
to run the company

157
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,840
with me and for the

158
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,440
first year or so things went well but

159
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
then our visions of the future began

160
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,160
to diverge and eventually we had a falling

161
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,840
out when we did our board of directors

162
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,440
sided with him and so at 30

163
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,440
I was out

164
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,960
and very publicly out what had been the

165
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,080
focus of

166
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,080
my entire adult life was gone and

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,400
it was devastating I really didn't know what

168
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,759
to do for a few months

169
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,759
I felt that I had

170
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,919
let the previous generation of

171
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,759
entrepreneurs down that I had dropped

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,599
the Baton as it

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,599
was being passed to me

174
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,000
I met with David Packard and Bob noise

175
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,720
and tried to apologize for screwing up so

176
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
badly I was a very public failure and

177
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,800
I even thought about running away from the

178
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,560
valley but something slowly began

179
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,039
to dawn on me I still loved what

180
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,160
I did the turn of

181
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,160
events at Apple had not

182
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,599
changed that one bit I'd been rejected

183
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,440
but I was still

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
in love and so

185
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
I decided to start over

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,879
I didn't see it then but it turned

187
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,039
out that getting fired from Apple was

188
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,639
the best thing that could have ever

189
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,160
happened to me the heaviness of being

190
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,280
successful was replaced by the lightness

191
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,479
of being a beginner again less sure

192
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,840
about everything it freed me to enter

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
one of the most creative periods per of

194
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
my life during the next 5 years

195
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,479
I started a company named next another

196
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,840
company named Pixar and fell in love

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,400
with an amazing woman who would become

198
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
my wife Pixar went on to create the

199
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,639
world's first computer animated feature

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,360
film Toy Story and is now the most

201
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,800
successful Animation Studio

202
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
in the world in

203
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
a remarkable turn of events

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
Apple bought next and I returned

205
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,199
to Apple and the technology we developed it

206
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,400
next is at the heart of Apple's current

207
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
Renaissance and L and

208
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
I have a wonderful family

209
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,199
together I'm pretty sure none of this

210
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,599
would have happened if I hadn't been

211
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,960
fired from Apple it was awful tasting

212
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,879
medicine but I guess the patient needed

213
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,879
it sometime life sometimes life's going

214
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,560
to hit you in

215
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,560
the head with a brick

216
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
don't lose faith I'm convinced that the

217
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,080
only thing that kept me going was that

218
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,720
I loved what I

219
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,720
did you've got to find

220
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,280
what you love and that

221
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,280
is as true for work

222
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,240
as it is for your

223
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,240
lovers your work is going

224
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,440
to fill a large part of your life

225
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,719
and the only way

226
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,719
to be truly satisfied is

227
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
to do what you believe is great work

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,240
and the only way to

229
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,240
do great work is to love

230
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,560
what you do if

231
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,560
you haven't found it yet

232
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,519
keep looking and don't settle as with

233
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
all matters of the heart you'll know

234
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,560
when you find it and like any great

235
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,240
relationship it just gets better

236
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,600
and better as the years roll on

237
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,600
so keep looking don't settle

238
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,880
death when

239
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,880
I was 17 I read a quote that

240
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,920
went something like if you live each day

241
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,000
as if it was your

242
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,000
last someday you'll most certainly

243
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,200
be right it made an impression on me

244
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
and since then for the past 33 years

245
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,079
I looked in the mirror every morning

246
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,680
and asked myself if

247
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,680
today were the last day

248
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,399
of my life what

249
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,399
I want to do what I am

250
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
about to do today and whenever the

251
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,000
answer has been no for too many days

252
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,519
in a row

253
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,519
I know I need to change

254
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,720
something remembering that I'll be dead

255
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
soon is the most important tool

256
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
I've ever encountered to

257
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
help me make the big

258
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
choices in life because almost

259
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
everything all external expectations all

260
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
Pride all fear of embarrassment or

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,519
failure these things just fall away

262
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,240
in the face of death

263
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,240
leaving only what is truly important

264
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
remembering that you are going to die is

265
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,720
the best way

266
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,720
I know to avoid the Trap of

267
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,720
thinking you have something to lose you

268
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,360
are already naked there is

269
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,360
no reason not to follow your

270
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,079
heart about a year ago I was diagnosed

271
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,279
with cancer I had a scan at 7:30

272
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,800
in the morning and

273
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,800
it clearly showed a tumor

274
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,240
on my pancreas

275
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,240
I didn't even know what a

276
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,320
pancreas was the doctors told me this

277
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,120
was almost certainly a type of cancer

278
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,200
that is incurable and that I should

279
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,279
expect to live no

280
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,279
longer than 3 to 6

281
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,040
months my doctor advised me to go home

282
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,279
and get my Affairs in order which is

283
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,880
doctor's code for prepare to die it

284
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,680
means to try and tell your kids

285
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,200
everything you thought you'd have the

286
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,519
next 10 years to tell

287
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,519
them in just a few

288
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,399
months it means to make sure everything

289
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
is buttoned up so that it will be

290
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,760
as easy as possible for your family it

291
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,839
means to say your goodbyes

292
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,120
I live with that diagnosis all day later

293
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
that evening I had a biopsy where

294
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,519
they stuck an endoscope down my throat

295
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,200
through my stomach and into

296
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,079
my intestines put a needle into my pancreas

297
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,160
and got a few cells from the tumor

298
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
I was sedated but

299
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
my wife who was there told

300
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,839
me that when they viewed the cells under

301
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,519
a microscope the doctor started crying

302
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,519
because it turned out

303
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,519
to be a very rare

304
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,720
form of pancreatic cancer that is

305
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,279
curable with surgery I had the surgery

306
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,279
and thankfully I'm fine

307
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,959
now this was the closest I've been

308
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,399
to facing death and

309
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,399
I hope it's the closest

310
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,760
I get for a few more decades having

311
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,600
lived through it I can now say this

312
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,279
to you with a

313
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,279
bit more certainty than when

314
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,040
death was a useful but purely intellectual

315
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,839
concept no one wants to die even people

316
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,399
who want to go to heaven don't want

317
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,279
to die to get there

318
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,279
and yet death is the

319
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,680
destination we all share no one has ever

320
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,079
escaped it and that is as it should

321
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,920
be because death is very likely the single

322
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,160
best invention of life it's life's

323
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,399
change agent it clears out the old

324
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,800
to make way for the

325
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,800
new right now the new

326
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,959
is you but someday

327
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,959
not too long from now

328
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,639
you will gradually become the old and

329
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,839
be cleared away sorry to be

330
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,839
so dramatic but it's quite

331
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,639
true your time is limited so don't waste

332
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,720
it living someone else's life don't

333
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,360
be trapped by Dogma which is living with

334
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,240
the results of other people's thinking

335
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
don't let the noise of others opinions

336
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
drown out your own inner voice and most

337
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,560
important have the courage to follow

338
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,079
your heart and intuition they somehow

339
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,560
already know what you truly want

340
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,560
to when

341
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,560
I was young there was an amazing

342
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,959
publication called the whole earth

343
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,720
catalog which was one of the Bibles of

344
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,000
my generation it was created by a fellow

345
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,519
named Stuart brand not far from here

346
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
in Meno Park and he

347
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
brought it to life with

348
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,199
his poetic touch this was in the late

349
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,639
60s before personal computers

350
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,839
and desktop publishing so it was all made

351
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,160
with typewriters scissors and Polaroid

352
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,800
cameras it was sort of like Google

353
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,399
in paperback form 35 years before Google

354
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,480
came along it was idealistic overflowing

355
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,920
with neat tools and great

356
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,320
Notions Stewart and his team put out

357
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,800
several issues of the whole earth

358
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
catalog and then when it had run its

359
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,759
course they put out a final issue

360
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,399
it was the mid 1970s and

361
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,399
I was your

362
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,680
age on the back cover of their final

363
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,199
issue was a photograph of an early

364
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,279
morning Country Road the kind you might

365
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,120
find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so

366
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,480
adventurous beneath it were the words

367
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,759
stay hungry stay foolish it was their

368
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,199
farewell message as they signed off stay

369
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,800
hungry stay foolish and

370
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,800
I have always wished that for

371
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,399
myself and now as you graduate to begin

372
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,610
a new

373
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,610
I wish that for you stay hungry

374
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,199
