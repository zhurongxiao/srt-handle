finest universities

in the world truth

8
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,520
be told uh I never graduated

from college and uh this is the closest

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:46,640
I've ever gotten to a college

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,079
graduation today I want to tell you

12
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,760
three stories from my life that's

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,760
it no big deal just three

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
stories the first story is

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,800
about connecting the dots

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,799
I dropped out of Reed College after the

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,920
first 6 months but then stayed around

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,200
as a drop in for another 18 months or so

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,159
before

20
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,119
I really quit so why' I drop out it started before

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,759
I was born my biological mother was a young

22
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,159
unwed graduate student and she decided

23
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,720
to put me up for

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,000
adoption she felt very strongly that

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
I should be adopted by college graduates

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,720
so everything was all set for me to

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,640
be adopted at Birth by a lawyer and a

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,320
his wife except that when I popped out

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,640
they decided at the last minute that

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,439
they really wanted a

31
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,240
girl so my parents who were on a waiting

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
list got a call in the middle of the

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,759
night asking we've got an unexpected

34
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,360
baby boy do you want him they said of

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,560
course my biological mother found out

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
later that my mother had never graduated

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,159
from college and that my father had

38
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,200
never graduated from high school

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,680
she refused to signed the final adoption

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,200
papers she only relented a few months

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,679
later when my parents promised that

42
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,720
I would go to college this was the start

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,360
in

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,160
my life and 17 years later I did go

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,319
to college but I naively chose a college

46
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,720
that was almost as expensive

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,560
as Stanford and all of my workingclass

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,800
parents savings were being spent on

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,599
my college tuition after 6 months

50
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,319
I couldn't see the value in it

51
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,760
I had no idea what I wanted to do with

52
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,080
my life and no idea how College was

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,120
going to help me figure it out and here

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,400
I was spending all the money my parents

55
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
had saved their entire life so I decided to drop out and trust

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,519
that it would all work out okay

57
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,480
it was pretty scary at the time but looking

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,920
back it was one of the best decisions

59
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,120
I ever

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,080
made the minute I dropped out

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,840
I could stop taking the required classes that

62
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,599
didn't interest me and begin dropping

63
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,480
in on the ones that looked far more

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
interesting it wasn't all romantic

65
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
I didn't have a dorm room so I slept

66
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,000
on the floor in friends rooms I returned

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Coke bottles for the 5-cent deposits

68
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,360
to buy food with and I would walk the seven

69
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,159
miles across town every Sunday night

70
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,040
to get one good meal a week at the Hari

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,319
Krishna Temple I loved it and much of

72
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
what I stumbled into by following

73
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
my curiosity and intuition turned out to

74
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
be Priceless later on let me give you one

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,239
example Reed College at that time

76
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
offered perhaps the best calligraphy

77
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,560
instruction in the country throughout

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,159
the campus every poster every label

79
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
on every drawer was beautifully hand

80
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,599
cigraph because I had dropped out

81
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,239
and didn't have to take the normal classes

82
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,519
I decided to take a calligraphy class

83
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,400
to learn how to do this I learned

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,959
about serif and Sans serif type faces

85
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,079
about varying the amount of space between

86
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,159
different letter combinations about

87
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,640
what makes great typography

88
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,400
great it was beautiful historical

89
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,879
artistically subtle in a way that

90
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,560
science can't capture and I found it

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,280
fascinating none of this had even a hope

92
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,160
of any practical application in

93
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,479
my life but 10 years later when we were

94
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,040
designing the first Macintosh computer

95
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,479
it all came back to me and we designed

96
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
it all into the Mac it was the first

97
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
computer with beautiful

98
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,759
typography if I had never never dropped

99
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,520
in on that single course in college the

100
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,120
Mac would have never had multiple type

101
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
faces or proportionately spaced fonts

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
and since Windows just copi the Mac it's

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,540
likely that no personal computer would

104
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,920
have

105
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
them if I had never dropped out I would

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,880
have never dropped in on that

107
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
calligraphy class and personal computers

108
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
might not have the wonderful typography

109
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,320
that they do of course it was impossible

110
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,880
to connect the dots looking forward when

111
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,000
I was in college but it was very very

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,199
clear looking backwards 10 years later

113
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,080
again you can't connect the dots looking

114
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,639
forward you can only connect them

115
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,280
looking backwards so you have to trust

116
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,320
that the dots will somehow connect

117
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,560
in your future you have to trust

118
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,840
in something your gut Destiny Life Karma

119
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,360
whatever because believing that the dots

120
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
will connect down the road will give you

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,800
the confidence to follow your heart even

122
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,639
when it leads you off the well-worn path

123
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:33,639
path and that will make all the

124
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,680
difference my second story is about love

125
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,080


126
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,160
and loss I was lucky I found what I love

127
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,639
to do early in life W and I started Apple

128
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,880
in my parents garage when I was 20 we

129
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,240
worked hard and in 10 years Apple had

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,759
grown from Just the Two of Us in a

131
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,600
garage into A2 billion doll company with

132
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
over 4,000 employees we just released

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
our finest creation the Macintosh a year

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,720
earlier and I just turned

135
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,919
30 and then I got

136
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,160
fired how can you get fired from a

137
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,639
company you

138
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,680
started well as Apple grew we hired

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,639
someone who I thought was very talented

140
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,840
to run the company with me and for the

141
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,440
first year or so things went well but

142
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
then our visions of the future began

143
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,160
to diverge and eventually we had a falling

144
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,840
out when we did our board of directors

145
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,440
sided with him and so at 30 I was out

146
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,960
and very publicly out what had been the

147
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,080
focus of my entire adult life was gone

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,960
and

149
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,400
it was devastating I really didn't know what

150
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,759
to do for a few months I felt that I had

151
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,919
let the previous generation of

152
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,759
entrepreneurs down that I had dropped

153
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,599
the Baton as it was being passed to me

154
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,000
I met with David Packard and Bob noise

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,720
and tried to apologize for screwing up so

156
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
badly I was a very public failure and

157
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,800
I even thought about running away from the

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,560
valley but something slowly began

159
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,039
to dawn on me I still loved what

160
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,160
I did the turn of events at Apple had not

161
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,599
changed that one bit I'd been rejected

162
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,440
but I was still

163
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
in love and so I decided to start

164
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,879
over I didn't see it then but it turned

165
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,039
out that getting fired from Apple was

166
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,639
the best thing that could have ever

167
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,160
happened to me the heaviness of being

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,280
successful was replaced by the lightness

169
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,479
of being a beginner again less sure

170
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,840
about everything it freed me to enter

171
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
one of the most creative periods per of

172
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
my life during the next 5 years

173
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,479
I started a company named next another

174
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,840
company named Pixar and fell in love

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,400
with an amazing woman who would become

176
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
my wife Pixar went on to create the

177
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,639
world's first computer animated feature

178
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,360
film Toy Story and is now the most

179
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,800
successful Animation Studio

180
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
in the world in a remarkable turn of events

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
Apple bought next and I returned

182
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,199
to Apple and the technology we developed it

183
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,400
next is at the heart of Apple's current

184
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
Renaissance and L and I have a wonderful

185
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,039
family

186
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,199
together I'm pretty sure none of this

187
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,599
would have happened if I hadn't been

188
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,960
fired from Apple it was awful tasting

189
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,879
medicine but I guess the patient needed

190
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,879
it sometime life sometimes life's going

191
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,560
to hit you in the head with a brick

192
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
don't lose faith I'm convinced that the

193
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,080
only thing that kept me going was that

194
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,720
I loved what I did you've got to find

195
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,280
what you love and that is as true for work

196
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,240
as it is for your lovers your work is going

197
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,440
to fill a large part of your life

198
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,719
and the only way to be truly satisfied is

199
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
to do what you believe is great work

200
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,240
and the only way to do great work is to love

201
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,560
what you do if you haven't found it yet

202
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,519
keep looking and don't settle as with

203
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
all matters of the heart you'll know

204
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,560
when you find it and like any great

205
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,240
relationship it just gets better

206
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,600
and better as the years roll on so keep

207
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:56,600
looking don't settle

208
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,839
my third story is

209
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,880
about death when I was 17 I read a quote that

210
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,920
went something like if you live each day

211
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,000
as if it was your last someday you'll

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
most certainly

213
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,200
be right it made an impression on me

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
and since then for the past 33 years

215
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,079
I looked in the mirror every morning

216
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,680
and asked myself if today were the last day

217
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,399
of my life what I want to do what I am

218
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
about to do today and whenever the

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,000
answer has been no for too many days

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,519
in a row I know I need to change

221
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,720
something remembering that I'll be dead

222
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
soon is the most important tool

223
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
I've ever encountered to help me make the big

224
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
choices in life because almost

225
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
everything all external expectations all

226
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
Pride all fear of embarrassment or

227
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,519
failure these things just fall away

228
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,240
in the face of death leaving only what is

229
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,640
truly important

230
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
remembering that you are going to die is

231
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,720
the best way I know to avoid the Trap of

232
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,720
thinking you have something to lose you

233
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,360
are already naked there is no reason not

234
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,800
to follow your

235
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,079
heart about a year ago I was diagnosed

236
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,279
with cancer I had a scan at 7:30

237
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,800
in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor

238
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,240
on my pancreas I didn't even know what a

239
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,320
pancreas was the doctors told me this

240
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,120
was almost certainly a type of cancer

241
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,200
that is incurable and that I should

242
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,279
expect to live no longer than 3 to 6

243
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,040
months my doctor advised me to go home

244
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,279
and get my Affairs in order which is

245
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,880
doctor's code for prepare to die it

246
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,680
means to try and tell your kids

247
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,200
everything you thought you'd have the

248
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,519
next 10 years to tell them in just a few

249
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,399
months it means to make sure everything

250
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
is buttoned up so that it will be

251
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,760
as easy as possible for your family it

252
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,839
means to say your goodbyes

253
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,120
I live with that diagnosis all day later

254
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
that evening I had a biopsy where

255
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,519
they stuck an endoscope down my throat

256
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,200
through my stomach and into

257
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,079
my intestines put a needle into my pancreas

258
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,160
and got a few cells from the tumor

259
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
I was sedated but my wife who was there told

260
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,839
me that when they viewed the cells under

261
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,519
a microscope the doctor started crying

262
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,519
because it turned out to be a very rare

263
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,720
form of pancreatic cancer that is

264
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,279
curable with surgery I had the surgery

265
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,279
and thankfully I'm fine

266
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,959
now this was the closest I've been

267
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,399
to facing death and I hope it's the closest

268
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,760
I get for a few more decades having

269
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,600
lived through it I can now say this

270
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,279
to you with a bit more certainty than when

271
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,040
death was a useful but purely

272
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,040
intellectual

273
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,839
concept no one wants to die even people

274
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,399
who want to go to heaven don't want

275
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,279
to die to get there and yet death is the

276
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,680
destination we all share no one has ever

277
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,079
escaped it and that is as it should

278
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,920
be because death is very likely the single

279
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,160
best invention of life it's life's

280
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,399
change agent it clears out the old

281
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,800
to make way for the new right now the new

282
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,959
is you but someday not too long from now

283
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,639
you will gradually become the old and

284
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,839
be cleared away sorry to be so dramatic but

285
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,399
it's quite

286
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,639
true your time is limited so don't waste

287
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,720
it living someone else's life don't

288
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,360
be trapped by Dogma which is living with

289
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,240
the results of other people's thinking

290
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
don't let the noise of others opinions

291
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
drown out your own inner voice and most

292
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,560
important have the courage to follow

293
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,079
your heart and intuition they somehow

294
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,560
already know what you truly want

295
00:12:59,560 --> 00:12:59,560
to become everything else is secondary

296
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,560
when I was young there was an amazing

297
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,959
publication called the whole earth

298
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,720
catalog which was one of the Bibles of

299
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,000
my generation it was created by a fellow

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,519
named Stuart brand not far from here

301
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
in Meno Park and he brought it to life with

302
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,199
his poetic touch this was in the late

303
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,639
60s before personal computers

304
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,839
and desktop publishing so it was all made

305
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,160
with typewriters scissors and Polaroid

306
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,800
cameras it was sort of like Google

307
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,399
in paperback form 35 years before Google

308
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,480
came along it was idealistic overflowing

309
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,920
with neat tools and great

310
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,320
Notions Stewart and his team put out

311
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,800
several issues of the whole earth

312
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
catalog and then when it had run its

313
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,759
course they put out a final issue

314
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,399
it was the mid 1970s and I was your

315
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,680
age on the back cover of their final

316
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,199
issue was a photograph of an early

317
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,279
morning Country Road the kind you might

318
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,120
find yourself hitchhiking on if you were

319
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,079
so

320
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,480
adventurous beneath it were the words

321
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,759
stay hungry stay foolish it was their

322
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,199
farewell message as they signed off stay

323
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,800
hungry stay foolish and I have always

324
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,120
wished that for

325
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,399
myself and now as you graduate to begin

326
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,610
a new I wish that for you stay hungry

327
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:50,700
stay foolish thank you all very
