ever gotten to a college

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,079
graduation today I want to tell you

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,760
three stories from my life that's it no

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,760
big deal just three

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
stories the first story is about

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,800
connecting the dots

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,799
I dropped out of Reed College after the

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,920
first 6 months but then stayed around as

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,200
a drop in for another 18 months or so

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,159
before I really

23
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,119
quit so why' I drop

24
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,400
out it started before I was

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,759
born my biological mother was a young

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,159
unwed graduate student and she decided

27
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,720
to put me up for

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,000
adoption she felt very strongly that I

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
should be adopted by college graduates

30
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,720
so everything was all set for me to be

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,640
adopted at Birth by a lawyer and a his

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,320
wife except that when I popped out they

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,640
decided at the last minute that they

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,439
really wanted a

35
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,240
girl so my parents who were on a waiting

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
list got a call in the middle of the

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,759
night asking we've got an unexpected

38
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,360
baby boy do you want him they said of

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,560
course my biological mother found out

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
later that my mother had never graduated

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,159
from college and that my father had

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,200
never graduated from high school she

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,680
refused to signed the final adoption

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,200
papers she only relented a few months

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,679
later when my parents promised that I

46
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,720
would go to college this was the start

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,360
in my

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,160
life and 17 years later I did go to

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,319
college but I naively chose a college

50
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,720
that was almost as expensive as

51
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,560
Stanford and all of my workingclass

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,800
parents savings were being spent on my

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,599
college tuition after 6 months I

54
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,319
couldn't see the value in it

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,760
I had no idea what I wanted to do with

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,080
my life and no idea how College was

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,120
going to help me figure it out and here

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,400
I was spending all the money my parents

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
had saved their entire

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,680
life so I decided to drop out and trust

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,519
that it would all work out okay it was

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,480
pretty scary at the time but looking

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,920
back it was one of the best decisions I

64
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,120
ever

65
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,080
made the minute I dropped out I could

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,840
stop taking the required classes that

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,599
didn't interest me and begin dropping in

68
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,480
on the ones that looked far more

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
interesting it wasn't all romantic I

70
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
didn't have a dorm room so I slept on

71
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,000
the floor in friends rooms I returned

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Coke bottles for the 5-cent deposits to

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,360
buy food with and I would walk the seven

74
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,159
miles across town every Sunday night to

75
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,040
get one good meal a week at the Hari

76
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,319
Krishna Temple I loved it and much of

77
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
what I stumbled into by following my

78
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
curiosity and intuition turned out to be

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
Priceless later on let me give you one

80
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,239
example Reed College at that time

81
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
offered perhaps the best calligraphy

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,560
instruction in the country throughout

83
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,159
the campus every poster every label on

84
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
every drawer was beautifully hand

85
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,599
cigraph because I had dropped out and

86
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,239
didn't have to take the normal classes I

87
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,519
decided to take a calligraphy class to

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,400
learn how to do this I learned about

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,959
serif and Sans serif type faces about

90
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,079
varying the amount of space between

91
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,159
different letter combinations about what

92
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,640
makes great typography

93
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,400
great it was beautiful historical

94
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,879
artistically subtle in a way that

95
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,560
science can't capture and I found it

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,280
fascinating none of this had even a hope

97
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,160
of any practical application in my

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,479
life but 10 years later when we were

99
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,040
designing the first Macintosh computer

100
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,479
it all came back to me and we designed

101
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
it all into the Mac it was the first

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
computer with beautiful

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,759
typography if I had never never dropped

104
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,520
in on that single course in college the

105
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,120
Mac would have never had multiple type

106
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
faces or proportionately spaced fonts

107
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
and since Windows just copi the Mac it's

108
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,540
likely that no personal computer would

109
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,920
have

110
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,980
[Applause]

111
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:47,980
[Music]

112
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
them if I had never dropped out I would

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,880
have never dropped in on that

114
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
calligraphy class and personal computers

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
might not have the wonderful typography

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,320
that they do of course it was impossible

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,880
to connect the dots looking forward when

118
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,000
I was in college but it was very very

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,199
clear looking backwards 10 years later

120
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,080
again you can't connect the dots looking

121
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,639
forward you can only connect them

122
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,280
looking backwards so you have to trust

123
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,320
that the dots will somehow connect in

124
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,560
your future you have to trust in

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,840
something your gut Destiny Life Karma

126
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,360
whatever because believing that the dots

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
will connect down the road will give you

128
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,800
the confidence to follow your heart even

129
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,639
when it leads you off the well-worn path

130
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:33,639
path and that will make all the

131
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,680
difference my second story is about love

132
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,080
and

133
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,160
loss I was lucky I found what I love to

134
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,639
do early in life W and I started Apple

135
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,880
in my parents garage when I was 20 we

136
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,240
worked hard and in 10 years Apple had

137
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,759
grown from Just the Two of Us in a

138
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,600
garage into A2 billion doll company with

139
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
over 4,000 employees we just released

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
our finest creation the Macintosh a year

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,720
earlier and I just turned

142
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,919
30 and then I got

143
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,160
fired how can you get fired from a

144
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,639
company you

145
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,680
started well as Apple grew we hired

146
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,639
someone who I thought was very talented

147
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,840
to run the company with me and for the

148
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,440
first year or so things went well but

149
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
then our visions of the future began to

150
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,160
diverge and eventually we had a falling

151
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,840
out when we did our board of directors

152
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,440
sided with him and so at 30 I was out

153
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,960
and very publicly out what had been the

154
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,080
focus of my entire adult life was gone

155
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,960
and it was

156
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,400
devastating I really didn't know what to

157
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,759
do for a few months I felt that I had

158
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,919
let the previous generation of

159
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,759
entrepreneurs down that I had dropped

160
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,599
the Baton as it was being passed to me I

161
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,000
met with David Packard and Bob noise and

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,720
tried to apologize for screwing up so

163
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
badly I was a very public failure and I

164
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,800
even thought about running away from the

165
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,560
valley but something slowly began to

166
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,039
dawn on me I still loved what I

167
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,160
did the turn of events at Apple had not

168
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,599
changed that one bit I'd been rejected

169
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,440
but I was still in

170
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
love and so I decided to start

171
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,879
over I didn't see it then but it turned

172
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,039
out that getting fired from Apple was

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,639
the best thing that could have ever

174
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,160
happened to me the heaviness of being

175
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,280
successful was replaced by the lightness

176
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,479
of being a beginner again less sure

177
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,840
about everything it freed me to enter

178
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
one of the most creative periods per of

179
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
my life during the next 5 years I

180
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,479
started a company named next another

181
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,840
company named Pixar and fell in love

182
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,400
with an amazing woman who would become

183
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
my wife Pixar went on to create the

184
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,639
world's first computer animated feature

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,360
film Toy Story and is now the most

186
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,800
successful Animation Studio in the

187
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
world in a remarkable turn of events

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
Apple bought next and I returned to

189
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,199
Apple and the technology we developed it

190
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,400
next is at the heart of Apple's current

191
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
Renaissance and L and I have a wonderful

192
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,039
family

193
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,199
together I'm pretty sure none of this

194
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,599
would have happened if I hadn't been

195
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,960
fired from Apple it was awful tasting

196
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,879
medicine but I guess the patient needed

197
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,879
it sometime life sometimes life's going

198
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,560
to hit you in the head with a brick

199
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
don't lose faith I'm convinced that the

200
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,080
only thing that kept me going was that I

201
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,720
loved what I did you've got to find what

202
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,280
you love and that is as true for work as

203
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,240
it is for your lovers your work is going

204
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,440
to fill a large part of your life and

205
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,719
the only way to be truly satisfied is to

206
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
do what you believe is great work and

207
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,240
the only way to do great work is to love

208
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,560
what you do if you haven't found it yet

209
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,519
keep looking and don't settle as with

210
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
all matters of the heart you'll know

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,560
when you find it and like any great

212
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,240
relationship it just gets better and

213
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,600
better as the years roll on so keep

214
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:56,600
looking don't settle

215
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:07,680
[Applause]

216
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,839
my third story is about

217
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,880
death when I was 17 I read a quote that

218
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,920
went something like if you live each day

219
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,000
as if it was your last someday you'll

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
most certainly be

221
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,200
right it made an impression on me and

222
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
since then for the past 33 years I

223
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,079
looked in the mirror every morning and

224
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,680
asked myself if today were the last day

225
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,399
of my life what I want to do what I am

226
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
about to do today and whenever the

227
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,000
answer has been no for too many days in

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,519
a row I know I need to change

229
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,720
something remembering that I'll be dead

230
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
soon is the most important tool I've

231
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
ever encountered to help me make the big

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
choices in life because almost

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
everything all external expectations all

234
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
Pride all fear of embarrassment or

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,519
failure these things just fall away in

236
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,240
the face of death leaving only what is

237
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,640
truly important

238
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
remembering that you are going to die is

239
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,720
the best way I know to avoid the Trap of

240
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,720
thinking you have something to lose you

241
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,360
are already naked there is no reason not

242
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,800
to follow your

243
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,079
heart about a year ago I was diagnosed

244
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,279
with cancer I had a scan at 7:30 in the

245
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,800
morning and it clearly showed a tumor on

246
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,240
my pancreas I didn't even know what a

247
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,320
pancreas was the doctors told me this

248
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,120
was almost certainly a type of cancer

249
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,200
that is incurable and that I should

250
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,279
expect to live no longer than 3 to 6

251
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,040
months my doctor advised me to go home

252
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,279
and get my Affairs in order which is

253
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,880
doctor's code for prepare to die it

254
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,680
means to try and tell your kids

255
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,200
everything you thought you'd have the

256
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,519
next 10 years to tell them in just a few

257
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,399
months it means to make sure everything

258
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
is buttoned up so that it will be as

259
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,760
easy as possible for your family it

260
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,839
means to say your goodbyes

261
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,120
I live with that diagnosis all day later

262
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
that evening I had a biopsy where they

263
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,519
stuck an endoscope down my throat

264
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,200
through my stomach and into my

265
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,079
intestines put a needle into my pancreas

266
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,160
and got a few cells from the tumor I was

267
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
sedated but my wife who was there told

268
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,839
me that when they viewed the cells under

269
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,519
a microscope the doctor started crying

270
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,519
because it turned out to be a very rare

271
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,720
form of pancreatic cancer that is

272
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,279
curable with surgery I had the surgery

273
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,279
and thankfully I'm fine

274
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,959
now this was the closest I've been to

275
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,399
facing death and I hope it's the closest

276
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,760
I get for a few more decades having

277
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,600
lived through it I can now say this to

278
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,279
you with a bit more certainty than when

279
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,040
death was a useful but purely

280
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,040
intellectual

281
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,839
concept no one wants to die even people

282
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,399
who want to go to heaven don't want to

283
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,279
die to get there and yet death is the

284
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,680
destination we all share no one has ever

285
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,079
escaped it and that is as it should be

286
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,920
because death is very likely the single

287
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,160
best invention of life it's life's

288
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,399
change agent it clears out the old to

289
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,800
make way for the new right now the new

290
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,959
is you but someday not too long from now

291
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,639
you will gradually become the old and be

292
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,839
cleared away sorry to be so dramatic but

293
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,399
it's quite

294
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,639
true your time is limited so don't waste

295
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,720
it living someone else's life don't be

296
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,360
trapped by Dogma which is living with

297
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,240
the results of other people's thinking

298
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
don't let the noise of others opinions

299
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
drown out your own inner voice and most

300
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,560
important have the courage to follow

301
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,079
your heart and intuition they somehow

302
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,560
already know what you truly want to

303
00:12:59,560 --> 00:12:59,560
become everything else is secondary

304
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:11,519
[Applause]

305
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,560
when I was young there was an amazing

306
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,959
publication called the whole earth

307
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,720
catalog which was one of the Bibles of

308
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,000
my generation it was created by a fellow

309
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,519
named Stuart brand not far from here in

310
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
Meno Park and he brought it to life with

311
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,199
his poetic touch this was in the late

312
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,639
60s before personal computers and

313
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,839
desktop publishing so it was all made

314
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,160
with typewriters scissors and Polaroid

315
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,800
cameras it was sort of like Google in

316
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,399
paperback form 35 years before Google

317
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,480
came along it was idealistic overflowing

318
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,920
with neat tools and great

319
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,320
Notions Stewart and his team put out

320
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,800
several issues of the whole earth

321
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
catalog and then when it had run its

322
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,759
course they put out a final issue it was

323
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,399
the mid 1970s and I was your

324
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,680
age on the back cover of their final

325
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,199
issue was a photograph of an early

326
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,279
morning Country Road the kind you might

327
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,120
find yourself hitchhiking on if you were

328
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,079
so

329
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,480
adventurous beneath it were the words

330
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,759
stay hungry stay foolish it was their

331
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,199
farewell message as they signed off stay

332
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,800
hungry stay foolish and I have always

333
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,120
wished that for

334
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,399
myself and now as you graduate to begin

335
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,610
a new I wish that for you stay hungry

336
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:50,700
stay foolish thank you all very

337
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,639
